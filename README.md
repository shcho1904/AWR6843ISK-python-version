1. Install all of required modules such as pyserial, PyQt (this is only for figure), numpy and so on.
2. Check your version of operating system e.g. Ubuntu, Windows, ..., and so on.
3. Change your port types according to your operating system e.g. COM11, COM12 for Windows, and tty for Linux.
4. If there are some errors, plz leave a comment for somebody else. Unfortunately, I'll not see any comments or revise the code.
5. The code is verified under Windows 12 and python 3.11.9 (not verified at Linux).
